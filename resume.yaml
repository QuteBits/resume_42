#   GENERAL GUIDELINES:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - if you change the name of any section in 'order' list (example: you rename
#   "PORTFOLIO" into "STUFF"), remember that you also have to change that name
#   in the resume-section.tmpl.tex
# - quote the strings with : or - because these are YAML special chars
# - avoid / symbol - it fucks up the height of some fonts
# - if _ (underscore) is needed in PDF: TeX needs \_ so you write \\_ in YAML
#   because YAML converts \\ to \
# - if _ is a part of url - put the whole url into \url{} brackets in TeX cause
#   otherwise www.let.it/be_good/ will compile to www.let.it/be in PDF on hover
# - COMPILE TWICE when done - needed by TeX to get the lastpage number right
